# e-halo
An app which helps its users drop their vaping addictions. Created with Google Firebase, Android Studio and Adobe Illustrator. For ind-depth information and screenshots, please see the commited "Pitch.pdf".

## The Problem
* Vaping usage amongst North American adolescents is rapidly increasing 
* Teens who use vapes are more likely to start smoking cigarettes 
* Vaping can: 
  * Lead to nicotine dependence
  * Affect memory, concentration, and alter teen brain development 
  * Reduce impulse control and cause behavioural and cognitive problems
  
## The Solution
We created e-halo, a mobile application intended to positively guide the youth to stop vaping. Derived and combined from the words “exhale” and “halo”, e-halo is a guiding application to encourage adolescents to stop inhaling and start seeing towards a brighter future.

## How e-halo works
#### Gamiﬁcation
Using daily streaks and weekly goals, the app encourages staying clean from vaping on a daily, consistent basis.
#### Friendly Competition
Using leaderboards, ranks, and friend rosters, the friendly competition adds more excitement for friends quitting together.
#### Positive Encouragement
Using positive words and helpful tips, users are encouraged to stop vaping for their own health beneﬁt.
